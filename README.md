# pascals-triangle
Just messing around with Pascals Triangle fractals.

Check out the `example.rb` file.

Some of the options you can pass for `display` or `display_line` are:
- padding - If you want to center the output (really only used for the display call)
- color1 - Background color
- color2 - Foreground color
- output_char - For fun and used mainly for the AsciiDisplay module.
